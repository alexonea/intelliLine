##About
intelliLine is my first attempt to create an perceptron and my first get in touch with the AI. The main goal of the application is to tell if a point (x1, y1) is above or below the x + y = 0 line. In this direction, a perceptron is created and trained on a range of 3000 points (for which we know if they are above or below the line). The application aims to visually demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm.

##How to test
To compile the sources, from the root directory:
`````bash
$ make
`````

To run the test, from the root directory:
`````bash
$ make run
`````bash

To remove the class files after you've finished running the test, from the root directory:
`````bash
$ make clean
`````
